# Freezer-catalog

The implemented API offers functionality for the Freezer catalog. For ease of understanding and further modifications and updates, there are several files: entity, service, repository interface, controller and main file.
The main challenges I had with this project is making sure I understood how to best use Spring Boot with my existing Java experience, as I am not very experienced in implementing Spring Boot APIs.
Some enhancements I would like to explore is a more user friendly return of data, implementing status codes and expanding the search by name method to include the possibility of multiple foods with similar names.


Main class of this project is FreezerCatalog.java
